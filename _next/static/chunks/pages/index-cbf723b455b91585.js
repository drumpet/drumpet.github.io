This isn't about a simple trait but rather those who could be categorized as having an actual personality disorder due to their self-centered thinking and instrumental view of others. Typically, it's extremely difficult for such individuals to succeed, but those narcissists who possess high intelligence have a significant advantage in achieving success. Narcissists do not hesitate to use any means necessary to achieve their goals, and their high intelligence often translates into strong problem-solving abilities, naturally leading to tremendous business growth.\n\nFrom an investor's perspective, as long as the investment is recouped in a large sum within seven years, it doesn't matter whether the company head is agreeable or not; this personality and capability mix that yields quick results is highly sought after. Over the past 2-3 years, I've seen several instances where companies have increased their value by hundreds of millions or even successfully exited, which is annoying but undeniably effective for increasing company value.\n\nPersonally, I cut ties with such individuals immediately. Although I will never make a fortune in my profession of coaching, one of the perks is not having to maintain relationships with people I don't like. If I had investments or a duty to manage investments and return profits, I would have to maintain some relationship with these problematic individuals, but fortunately, I don't have to.\n\nMoreover, once a company's value exceeds hundreds to thousands of millions, this type of person significantly diminishes. It's for the same reason narcissists never dominate our world: they lack stamina. They are like dairy desserts with a very short shelf life—intensely nurtured for about five years, but then they rapidly lose focus or prioritize satisfying their egos over the success of the business (which is why they often attempt early exits, knowing they won't last long).\n"})]})}}},function(e){e.O(0,[287,888,774,179],function(){return e(e.s=5557)}),_N_E=e.O()}]);
